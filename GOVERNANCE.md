# webpack Project Governance

The webpack Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the technical governing body of webpack It is described in the [TSC Charter](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-governance/blob/main/TSC_CHARTER.md).

## TSC scope

The TSC is responsible for the webpack/webpack project, some projects depended upon by webpack/webpack, and several projects adjacent to webpack.

The TSC exercises autonomy in managing its responsibilities and seeks agreement from the OpenJS Foundation Board on any change to the scope of those responsibilities as defined below.

### List of TSC responsibilities

The TSC exercises autonomy in setting up and maintaining procedures, policies, and management and administrative structures as it deems appropriate for the maintenance and operation of these projects and resources.

Included in the responsibilities of the TSC are:

- Managing code and documentation creation and changes for the listed projects
  and resources
- Setting and maintaining standards covering contributions of code,
  documentation, and other materials
- Managing code and binary releases: types, schedules, frequency, delivery
  mechanisms
- Making decisions regarding dependencies of the webpack/webpack project,
  including what those dependencies are and how they are bundled with source
  code and releases
- Creating new repositories and projects under the webpack GitHub organization
  as required
- Setting overall technical direction for the webpack/webpack project, including
  high-level goals and low-level specifics regarding features and functionality
- Setting and maintaining appropriate standards for community discourse via the
  various mediums under TSC control
- Setting and maintaining governance rules for the conduct and make-up of the
  TSC, Working Groups and other bodies within the TSC's domain

Many of these responsibilities will be delegated by the TSC to appropriate bodies such as the Working Groups.

## TSC members

TSC members are responsible for top-level technical community concerns. The role is mostly administrative and is responsible for admitting new Working Groups and advocating for any needs in the technical side of the project to the OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors.

TSC members can nominate new members at any time. Candidates for membership tend to be people who have a competency for community management and a high tolerance and patience for process minutiae as the TSC delegates most of its responsibilities to other working groups.

A [current list of TSC members](https://github.com/webpack/webpack#tsc-technical-steering-committee) is maintained in the main webpack repository.

## Working Groups

All documents related Working Groups (WGs), how to form a WG, and the responsibilities of a WG can be found in the [WORKING_GROUPS.md](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-governance/blob/main/WORKING_GROUPS.md) file.

## Expenses & OpenCollective

The webpack project funds and expenses are documented on the [OPEN_COLLECTIVE.md](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-governance/blob/main/OPEN_COLLECTIVE.md) file.

## Policy change proposal process

The webpack TSC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all Working Groups. Working Groups have broad powers of self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes that are intended to cover all Working Groups, a PR should be opened against this repository (webpack/governance).

The pull request can be labeled `tsc-agenda` to request that it be put on the agenda for the next TSC meeting.

The OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors retains certain rights (especially legal considerations). If the TSC endorses a proposal, they will escalate to the OpenJS Foundation Board of Directors when required to do so.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to their charters. The TSC can not mandate existing working groups alter their charters. If such a situation arises, the TSC may decide to revoke the group's charter.
